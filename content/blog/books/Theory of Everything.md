# Theory of Everything by Stephen Hawking

I loved this book when i read it in 10th grade, though i forgot few concepts, I think I understood theory of relativity and the singularity that resides within the black hole.

I'm pumped up to find more things on space as ever before, if my career trajectory could go on that direction, I would be so grateful. I want to work with netflix, spacex, and I would like to be a pioneer in interplantery communications.
