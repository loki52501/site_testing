# Notes from Security Internships
*Published on 2025-10-15*

Highlights across identity, cloud security, and network detection work.

## Identity Automation (iMerit)
- Automated onboarding/offboarding across Ivanti, Google Workspace, and AD; cut access errors and ~60% onboarding time.
- Standardized RBAC via Python + REST pipelines.

## Cloud Security (Invisbl)
- Refactored AWS IAM in line with NIST 800-53 AC and CIS AWS Foundations.
- Built Python + Lambda + Elasticsearch detections for high-priority events (ISO/IEC 27001 ops-aligned).

## Network Detection (Anna University)
- Hybrid LSTM-CNN on UNSW-NB15 caught malicious traffic (~80% accuracy).
- Treated reporting like incident response docs for faculty stakeholders.
