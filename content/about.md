# About

I am an early-career engineer with a background in **cybersecurity** and a long-term goal to work on:

1. **AI infrastructure / ML systems** (primary), and  
2. **Quantitative / trading-style systems** (secondary).

Rather than chasing buzzwords, I am deliberately building:

- **Strong fundamentals** in Python, C++, algorithms, and distributed systems
- **Practical ML skills** in PyTorch and MLOps
- **A security-informed mindset** for designing robust, failure-aware systems


## My current focus

### 1. AI Infrastructure and ML Systems

I am following a structured roadmap centered on:

- **PyTorch first:** tensors, autograd, CNNs, training loops  
- **Distributed systems:** *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* (DDIA) and MIT 6.824  
- **ML system design:** reading Chip Huyen and studying real-world ML platforms  
- **MLOps tools:** MLflow, Docker, Ray, Kubernetes basics

The goal is to be able to:

- Design and explain an **end-to-end ML system** (data → training → serving → monitoring)  
- Discuss **trade-offs** in model deployment, scaling, and reliability  
- Implement and debug real systems, not just notebooks


### 2. Security-informed Engineering

Coming from cybersecurity, I care about:

- How systems **fail under adversarial or unexpected inputs**  
- How to reason about **observability, logging, and forensics**  
- Reducing attack surface and building **defense-in-depth** into ML systems

This perspective is especially relevant for:

- **Fraud detection** (e.g., payments, abuse detection)  
- **Security AI** (LLMs + security pipelines, anomaly detection)  
- **Mission-critical ML** where reliability matters as much as accuracy


### 3. Quant-leaning Backup Path

As a secondary trajectory, I am exploring:

- **Low-latency systems & networking**  
- **Probability / statistics / expected value** problems  
- Architectures used by **trading firms and exchanges** (market data, order matching, risk systems)

This is not a hobby; it is a deliberate hedge in case the best-fit opportunities arise in **quant / trading infrastructure** rather than “traditional” tech.


## How I work

- **Plan-driven:** I follow a written, time-bounded roadmap instead of jumping randomly between topics.  
- **Project-first:** I anchor learning in **concrete projects** (e.g., ThreatLens, static site generator) rather than pure theory.  
- **Feedback-seeking:** I iterate based on feedback from instructors, peers, and real interview-style problems.


## What I want next

I am looking for opportunities where I can:

- Work on **training, serving, or data platforms for ML**  
- Contribute to systems that require **performance + reliability**  
- Use my **security background** to improve robustness and safety of ML-powered products
