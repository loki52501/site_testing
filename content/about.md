# About

I am an early-career engineer with a background in **cybersecurity** and a long-term goal to work on:

1. **AI infrastructure / ML systems** 

Rather than chasing buzzwords, I am deliberately building:

- **Strong fundamentals** in Python, C++, algorithms, and distributed systems
- **Practical ML skills** in PyTorch and MLOps
- **A security-informed mindset** for designing robust, failure-aware systems

## My current focus

### 1. AI Infrastructure and ML Systems

I am following a structured roadmap centered on:

- **PyTorch first:** tensors, autograd, CNNs, training loops  
- **Distributed systems:** *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* (DDIA) and MIT 6.824  
- **ML system design:** reading Chip Huyen and studying real-world ML platforms  
- **MLOps tools:** MLflow, Docker, Ray, Kubernetes basics

The goal is to be able to:

- Design and explain an **end-to-end ML system** (data → training → serving → monitoring)  
- Discuss **trade-offs** in model deployment, scaling, and reliability  
- Implement and debug real systems, not just notebooks


### 2. Security-informed Engineering

Coming from cybersecurity, I care about:

- How systems **fail under adversarial or unexpected inputs**  
- How to reason about **observability, logging, and forensics**  
- Reducing attack surface and building **defense-in-depth** into ML systems

This perspective is especially relevant for:

- **Fraud detection** (e.g., payments, abuse detection)  
- **Security AI** (LLMs + security pipelines, anomaly detection)  
- **Mission-critical ML** where reliability matters as much as accuracy



## How I work

- **Plan-driven:** I follow a written, time-bounded roadmap instead of jumping randomly between topics.  
- **Project-first:** I anchor learning in **concrete projects** (e.g., ThreatLens, static site generator) rather than pure theory.  
- **Feedback-seeking:** I iterate based on feedback from instructors, peers, and real interview-style problems.
