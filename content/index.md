# Lokesh LKS — Software Architect & Systems Programmer

I design and build large-scale systems. My work spans **cloud infrastructure**, **C++ systems programming**, **ML pipelines**, and **security engineering**, with a current focus on **LLM security** and **Linux hardening**.

I keep my algorithms sharp through daily competitive programming and maintain a strong grasp of distributed systems fundamentals.

## What I Do Daily

- Architect systems for scale, reliability, and performance
- Write production C++ for performance-critical components
- Build and secure cloud infrastructure
- Deploy ML systems from training to production
- Harden Linux environments and secure LLM deployments
- Grind DSA and competitive programming problems
- Ship side projects that solve real problems

## Looking For

Roles where I can apply systems thinking and security-first design:

- Software Architect / Principal Engineer
- Cloud Infrastructure Engineer
- C++ Systems Engineer
- ML Infrastructure / Security Engineer
- Backend Engineer (distributed systems)

If you're building production systems at scale and care about performance and security, let's talk.


## Flagship Projects

### Custom Static Site Generator (this site)

A **C++17 static site generator** that converts Markdown → HTML and auto-builds this portfolio.

- C++17, STL, `\<filesystem\>`, regex, CLI tooling  
- Markdown parser, HTML templating, auto-generated navigation  
- GitHub Actions CI for **auto-deploy to GitHub Pages**

[See details on the Projects page](projects.html)


### ThreatLens (AI for Security)

End-to-end **intrusion / anomaly detection** pipeline:

- Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas  
- Experimented with **LSTM / CNN**-style models on network-style data  
- Focus on **throughput, latency, and deployment** rather than just accuracy


## Technical Skills

**Core Programming**

- **C++** (17/20): Systems programming, performance optimization, STL, templates
- **Python**: ML pipelines, automation, scripting
- **SQL**: Query optimization, database design

**Cloud & Infrastructure**

- Cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Distributed systems design (replication, partitioning, consensus)
- Docker, Kubernetes basics
- Linux systems programming and hardening

**Machine Learning & Security**

- PyTorch, TensorFlow
- ML system architecture (training → serving → monitoring)
- LLM security: prompt injection defense, output filtering, secure model serving
- MLOps, experiment tracking, pipeline orchestration
- NumPy, Pandas, data processing at scale

**Daily Practice**

- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Daily competitive programming
- System design patterns and trade-offs
- Code review and software craftsmanship


## Why Work With Me

- **Architectural mindset**: I design systems that scale, not just code that works
- **Performance-focused**: C++ background drives efficiency thinking across all work
- **Full-stack systems**: From cloud infrastructure to ML pipelines to production deployment
- **Continuous learner**: Daily DSA practice keeps algorithms sharp, side projects keep skills current
- **Production-ready**: I build for reliability, maintainability, and long-term success

If you're building the kind of systems that challenge conventional limits, I want to be part of your team.
