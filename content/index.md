# Lokesh L.K.S

Hi, I am me, and currently pursuing MS in Cybersecurity at Penn State (graduating May 2026) with hands-on experience in **cloud security automation**, **infrastructure security**, and **AI-powered network security systems**.

Currently building **EdgeStreamAI**—an intelligent operations platform for Netflix-scale live streaming events—as my master's capstone. I combine security engineering fundamentals with emerging AI technologies to solve real-world problems at scale.

Looking for **new grad roles** starting Summer 2026 in network security, infrastructure engineering, or cloud security engineering.

## Current Work

### EdgeStreamAI (Master's Capstone)
*Intelligent Operations Platform for Live Streaming at Scale*

Designing a hybrid system for Netflix-scale live events (200M+ concurrent viewers):
- **Edge layer**: Algorithmic quality optimization, routing, DDoS detection (<5ms latency)
- **AI layer**: Gemini 3-powered natural language assistant for engineering teams
- **Security research**: Adversarial attack testing on AI operations systems
- **Scale**: Simulating FIFA 2027 World Cup scenarios with 6,000 global edge locations

**Tech**: Python, Gemini 3 API, NetworkX, Streamlit, Network Simulation  
**Timeline**: January - May 2026

## What I'm Looking For

**New grad/entry-level positions** where I can apply my background in security and infrastructure:

- **Network Security Engineer** - Especially at streaming/CDN companies
- **Infrastructure/Systems Engineer** - Focus on security and scale
- **Cloud Security Engineer** - AWS/cloud-native security
- **Security Engineer** - Application and infrastructure security

**Dream companies**: Netflix, Cloudflare, Akamai, Fastly, AWS, Google Cloud, Datadog

I'm particularly interested in roles at companies building large-scale, high-performance systems where security and reliability are critical. If you're solving Netflix-scale problems, I want to contribute.

## Why Work With Me

**Security-First Mindset**: Security+ certified with hands-on AWS IAM and infrastructure security experience

**AI + Security Intersection**: Building EdgeStreamAI demonstrates I can apply emerging AI technologies to real infrastructure problems

**Real Production Experience**: Automated identity workflows at iMerit, built threat detection at Invisbl—I've shipped code that runs in production

**Continuous Learner**: Daily algorithm practice, reading distributed systems books, building side projects—I'm always improving

**Systems Thinking**: EdgeStreamAI shows I can design for scale (200M users), not just write code that works
