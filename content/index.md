# Lokesh LKS — AI Infrastructure, Security & Quant-leaning Engineer

I design and build systems at the intersection of **AI infrastructure**, **distributed systems**, and **security**, with a secondary interest in **quantitative finance**.

Right now I am:

- Executing a focused roadmap in **PyTorch**, **distributed systems**, and **ML system design** to move into AI infrastructure / ML platform roles:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Sharpening **C++ / Python** and **data structures & algorithms** daily
- Exploring **low-latency systems** and **trading-style architectures** as a backup path into quant


## What I’m looking for

- **Roles:** AI Infrastructure / ML Systems Engineer, Platform ML Engineer, Security-focused ML Engineer  
- **Secondary path:** Quantitative developer / research engineer roles with strong systems + math focus  
- **Timeline:** Internships and early-career roles aligned with a 2026 start

If you’re hiring for teams working on **model training, serving, data/feature platforms, or security for ML systems**, I’d like to talk.


## Flagship Projects

### Custom Static Site Generator (this site)

A **C++17 static site generator** that converts Markdown → HTML and auto-builds this portfolio.

- C++17, STL, `<filesystem>`, regex, CLI tooling  
- Markdown parser, HTML templating, auto-generated navigation  
- GitHub Actions CI for **auto-deploy to GitHub Pages**

[See details on the Projects page](/projects.html)


### ThreatLens (AI for Security)

End-to-end **intrusion / anomaly detection** pipeline:

- Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas  
- Experimented with **LSTM / CNN**-style models on network-style data  
- Focus on **throughput, latency, and deployment** rather than just accuracy


### AI Infrastructure Roadmap

A structured 4–6 month plan to grow from **cybersecurity + systems** to **AI infra engineer**, covering:

- PyTorch + ML fundamentals  
- Distributed systems (DDIA, MIT 6.824)  
- ML system design & MLOps (MLflow, Ray, Kubernetes basics)  
- Interview-focused DSA and system design practice

## Skills Snapshot

**Languages**

- C++, Python, SQL, basic Bash

**Systems & Infra**

- Linux, networking basics, Docker  
- Distributed systems fundamentals (replication, partitioning, CAP trade-offs)

**ML & Data**

- PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas  
- ML system design (training → serving → monitoring)  
- Experiment tracking, reproducible pipelines

**Security**

- Cybersecurity foundations (network security mindset)  
- Threat/anomaly detection framing, adversarial thinking


## Why this profile is a fit

- **Systems + security DNA:** I naturally think about **failure modes, adversaries, and robustness**, which maps well to production ML systems and fraud/security use cases.
- **AI infra trajectory:** My plan is explicitly optimized for **AI infra / ML platform roles**, not generic “ML engineer” work.
- **Quant-leaning:** Strong interest in **low-latency, data-heavy systems**, relevant to trading, market data infrastructure, and risk systems.

If this aligns with your team’s work, reach out — I’m building for exactly this niche.
