# Projects

A curated set of projects chosen to showcase **systems thinking**, **AI infrastructure direction**, and **security mindset**.


## Custom Static Site Generator (C++17)

This portfolio is generated by a **static site generator I wrote in C++**.

**Highlights**

- Parses Markdown and emits HTML using a simple template system  
- Supports headers, emphasis, lists, links, images, code blocks, and paragraphs  
- Uses C++17 `<filesystem>` to walk the `content/` directory and generate pages into `docs/`  
- Auto-build navigation from available `.md` files  
- Includes helper scripts and a GitHub Actions workflow for **automatic deployment to GitHub Pages**

**Why it matters**

- Demonstrates **C++ proficiency**, file I/O, string processing, and basic parsing  
- Shows that I can build **tooling around my own workflow**  
- Exhibits **CI/CD awareness** via GitHub Actions and static hosting


## ThreatLens — ML-Powered Security Analytics

An ongoing project to build an **ML pipeline for network-style threat / anomaly detection**.

**Stack**

- Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas  
- Experiment tracking with simple logging and plans to integrate MLflow  
- Docker for containerization

**Core ideas**

- Treat traffic / event sequences as **time-series** and experiment with **LSTM / CNN**-style architectures  
- Focus on **latency and throughput** (how fast can we score events?)  
- Design training, evaluation, and (eventually) serving loops that mirror real production constraints

**What it shows**

- Ability to move from **raw data → features → models → evaluation**  
- Understanding of **trade-offs between complexity and deployability**  
- Direct connection to **Security AI / fraud / anomaly detection** roles


## AI Infrastructure Roadmap (Meta-Project)

A written, time-bound roadmap to grow into an **AI infrastructure / ML systems engineer**, covering:

- **4+ months** of structured work in Python, PyTorch, DSA, distributed systems, and ML system design  
- Integration of **DDIA, MIT 6.824, Chip Huyen, Alex Xu** system design resources  
- Continuous **LeetCode and system design practice** targeted at real interviews:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

**Why list a roadmap as a project?**

- It is **concrete and visible**: a living document with milestones, not a vague intention  
- It demonstrates **planning ability and self-management**  
- It signals to recruiters that I am serious about **AI infra**, not generic “AI”


## (Optional) Research & Writing

If applicable/available, you can highlight:

### AI Collaboration: Shared vs. Individual Contexts

A research initiative on how groups collaborate with AI tools:

- Compares **shared group context** vs **individual context** when using LLMs  
- Looks at information sharing, dominance, and creativity in group problem-solving  
- Connects social-informatics theory with practical AI tool design

This work shows:

- Ability to **reason about complex socio-technical systems**  
- Comfort reading and synthesizing **research literature**  
- Interest in how tools shape **collaboration and cognition**

## What I want to build next

- A small **distributed key-value store** (Raft-based) to deepen distributed systems expertise  
- A **model serving stack** (FastAPI / TorchServe + Docker + basic Kubernetes)  
- A simplified **market data / order book simulator** to connect infra skills with quant-style workloads

If any of this aligns with the work your team does, I’d be happy to discuss technical details.
