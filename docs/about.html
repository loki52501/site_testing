            <h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>I'm Lokesh, a cybersecurity grad student at Penn State who accidentally ended up in Singapore during their National Day (the fireworks were amazing, but I had no idea why everyone was celebrating until someone told me).</p>
<p>I play chess competitively—well enough , and did Skating enough to earn spots in the Limca Book of Records and Asia Book of Records. Chess taught me to think several moves ahead, which turns out to be pretty useful when designing secure systems at scale.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm building EdgeStreamAI for my master's capstone—an AI-powered operations platform for Netflix-scale live streaming. But the project I'm most excited about? A production-level e-commerce site for my mother's organic shop back home.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-actually-do">What I Actually Do</h2>
<p><strong>During the day</strong>: Building secure, scalable systems. I've automated infrastructure security workflows, designed AWS IAM policies, and built ML models for network intrusion detection. My sweet spot is where AI meets network security—especially at massive scale.</p>
<p><strong>After hours</strong>: Reading (just finished "Thinking, Fast and Slow"—mind-bending stuff about how we make decisions), watching movies (counting down to Avatar: Fire and Ash), and working on side projects that solve real problems for real people.</p>
<h2 id="my-technical-philosophy">My Technical Philosophy</h2>
<p>Coming from cybersecurity, I think about systems differently:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Security first</strong>: How does this fail under attack?</li>
  <li><strong>Scale matters</strong>: Will this work at 200M concurrent users?</li>
  <li><strong>Real-world constraints</strong>: Latency, cost, reliability—not just "does it work in the demo?"</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't chase buzzwords. I build things that work, then make them secure, then make them scale.</p>
<h2 id="current-focus-graduating-may-2026">Current Focus (Graduating May 2026)</h2>
<p><strong>Building</strong>: EdgeStreamAI—proving I can design systems for Netflix-scale challenges</p>
<p><strong>Learning</strong>: DDIA (Kleppmann), distributed systems fundamentals, real-time infrastructure at scale</p>
<p><strong>Looking for</strong>: New grad roles where I can apply security engineering + AI to real infrastructure problems. Dream companies: Netflix, Cloudflare, companies building systems that millions depend on.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-code">Beyond Code</h2>
<p>Chess player, Skater (records holder), movie enthusiast, book worm. I believe the best engineers are interesting humans first, and that curiosity about the world makes you better at solving technical problems.</p>
<p>If you're building something ambitious and want someone who thinks about security, scale, and how things actually break in production—let's talk.</p>
